      <li>
        <span class="project-name">I still remember the thrill of my first hack. I was just a teenager, messing around with my friend's computer, trying to figure out how to bypass the admin password. And then, suddenly, I was in. I had access to everything. It was like a rush of adrenaline, a sense of power and control.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="project-name">From that day on, I was hooked. I spent every spare moment learning, experimenting, and pushing the limits of what was possible. I built my own tools, crafted my own exploits, and explored the darkest corners of the internet.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="project-name">My first big project was a web scanner, designed to identify vulnerabilities in websites and servers. It was a beast of a program, capable of scanning thousands of sites in a matter of hours. I used it to identify weaknesses in some of the biggest companies in the world, and then... well, let's just say I made a name for myself in certain circles.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="project-name">But that was just the beginning. I went on to build a password cracker, capable of breaking even the strongest encryption. I used it to gain access to secure systems, to uncover secrets and expose weaknesses. And then, of course, there was the SQL injection tool, designed to exploit vulnerabilities in databases and extract sensitive information.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="project-name">People say I'm a hacker, a cybercriminal, a threat to national security. But I know the truth. I'm a explorer, a pioneer, a master of the digital realm. And my projects are just the beginning.</span>
